# nquick

A note taker built just for me because I'm too lazy to open up Google Keep/Evernote/iNotes/another program. Currently on 0.0.2.

[Here](https://github.com/gruiz17/nquick/releases) is the latest release (includes binary).

I will keep adding to this as I get lazier about my note taking/get more ideas.

## Installation
You have two options:

1) download the binary from the releases.

2) install [lein bin](https://github.com/Raynes/lein-bin) and run install.sh.

## Usage

* `read` - to read your collected notes (optional `-n` for a specific note)
* `write {{whatever you want in here insert anything}}` - to write a note. This will prompt you for a title after you are done writing
* `purge` - to purge your collected notes (optional `-n` to destroy a specific note)
* `names` - to list notes you have written so far
* `help` - to display help

## TODO

* unit testing
* think of more features

## Features

* Create
* Read
* Delete
